			 <p>This was my submission for <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe-con/">axe-con 2024</a> which unfortunately did not make it to the conference. Let me know if the topic would be interesting for you and you would like to hear more about the topic!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Enough with the baby steps! Let’s make accessibility leaps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Outline:</strong> So much of our work is based on nudging people into the right direction. Applying a little pressure that makes a change but is not disruptive. This needs to change. This talk showcases steps that we can take that make instant notable differences for disabled people using websites and apps by using policy changes that are strong and disruptive once, instead of continuous glacially slow progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Additional Information:</strong> I don’t expect this to be the most technical talk, but it might be most suitable for people who lead teams or companies, hence I selected intermediate. The talk’s goal is to shake people awake and show how gradually improving accessibility is often not the best way to spend their effort.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(Slightly edited for grammar.)</p>

			 <p>With ARIA and JavaScript, you can make any code “accessible” if your definition is “mapped somewhat correctly to screen reader APIs and work with the keyboard”. Accessibility has so many more facets than that.</p>

			 <p><em><a href="https://twitter.com/yatil/status/1556899672731574274">This is a repost of a Twitter thread</a> from August 2022. Slightly edited in format and for clarity.</em></p>
<p>Accessibility must work within the constraints of an ableist world to improve things. I hope it can help to make the world a tiny bit less unjust every day.</p>
<p>I have seen accessibility people say “this is a hill I’m willing to die on” and then they died on that proverbial hill.</p>
<p>Some clients just don’t care, and you have no power to make them care. You can make them aware, you can put procedures in place, you can point at laws. But you can’t change their attitude.</p>
<p>And yes, that might mean that the products of the process are… mediocre at best.</p>
<p>That is disappointing for the accessibility professionals involved, who did their best in the circumstances, and still fail many disabled people.</p>
<p>I think it’s still important to do this work:</p>
<p>Awareness is important, and when more people are aware that accessibility is a thing, more people will be willing to invest in it. This is a slow process, but I have seen it in real life: Companies that have an audit done for compliance and then want to get better.</p>
<p>And sometimes you inspire people to get into accessibility and they might be having an impact for a long time.</p>
<p>Is any of this optimal? No.</p>
<p>Do I wish I had a magic wand that made disability justice a reality and everyone care? You bet!</p>
<p>But I don’t, and so I need to have my practice grounded in the reality of the world as it is, as it otherwise becomes burnout inducing.</p>
<p><strong>And if we cannot afford one thing, that’s people quitting accessibility because they are burned out. Because they feel that they are ineffective and their work is worthless.
I feel like that all the time.</strong></p>
<p>That said, the <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/#errors">WebAIM Million study</a> shows that between 2019 and 2022 the average error per page has decreased and the most common issues have also decreased. The web is slowly getting better.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that we must change the systems to make web accessibility easier, especially aligning what’s right with what’s easy. Currently a lot of accessibility practices on the web are hidden or require additional knowledge. That is an ableist barrier itself.</p>
<p>I wrote about <a href="https://yatil.net/blog/fix-web-accessibility-systematically">changing the system on my blog</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/PZYiweHuo_I">I also recorded a talk about the topic.</a></p>

			 <p>You always need to be very clear in what you mean. Otherwise, it is hard to read for your audience. Always include brackets with the element names. You can differentiate attributes and values by using these words. Always include the word “value” when talking about values.</p>
<ul>
<li>First mention of an element: “<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element”</li>
<li>First mention of an attribute: “<code>id</code> attribute”</li>
<li>First mention of a value: “<code>my-great-id</code> value”</li>
<li>Subsequent mention of an element:  “<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>” or “<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element”</li>
<li>Subsequent mention of an attribute: “<code>id</code>” or “<code>id</code> attribute”</li>
<li>Subsequent mention of a value: “<code>my-great-id</code> value”</li>
<li>Avoid the use of “tag” when the whole element is the subject of the sentence, do only use “tag” when it is specific to the start or end tag. Always specify “start tag” or “end tag”.</li>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Theories abound that Silicon Valley executives got together to slash jobs. Or that a cabal of hedge funds conspired and forced them to do it.</p>
<p>While I have literally no insight into these companies, I think the reason is “the market” of capitalism. These companies are very similar in how they operate and how they are structured. And they are all &ldquo;public&rdquo; companies, meaning that their share price is one of the most important measures of success.</p>
<p>As the cost of doing business rises due to inflation, the share price is under threat. And because it used to be good for the share price to stockpile new employees – even for the simple reason of keeping that talent out of the hands of your competitors – it is no longer seen as appropriate. So companies are doing what they need to do to stabilise the share price and avoid bad press.</p>
<p>One company in particular that has not announced layoffs is Apple, where Tim Cook took a 40% pay cut. He didn&rsquo;t do it out of the goodness of his heart either, but because his “ballooning compensation” was becoming a problem with shareholders. I am sure Apple will try not to do what all its competitors are doing, because it has often worked to their advantage, and Cook&rsquo;s pay cut can act as a shield against some bad press. Sometimes you gotta zig when everybody else is zagging.</p>
<p>What it shows is that employees, especially in large, monopolistic companies, are used as pawns to keep investors happy. Tenure and success don&rsquo;t matter if you can be made redundant to make the figures look good.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need people conspiring to do this, you just need a system that rewards this behaviour.</p>

<em>This needs to have serious consequences.</em></p>
<p>Why is nobody taking the worries and fears that young people have regarding climate change seriously? Why do right-wing, climate-denying, anti-vaxx groups have worries and fears that need to be taken seriously? Doesn’t it make sense that a whole generation feels abandoned and not taken seriously? Are we supposed to be surprised if they are getting desparate? This is the question that I want politicians to ask themselves. And then make it right.</p>

<p>Like the Everything Bagel, we think we know what should be included. We assume certain features are important. When I started working with Manton Reece on Micro.blog, I was the one peppering him with questions, such is how do I retweet, why no hashtags, where can I find out who is following me and how many followers I have. I thought Micro.blog should be Twitter minus the trolls. I had no way to imagine another way of doing things. Where are my poppy seeds?</p>
<p>Today, over five years later, I treasure what we have built at Micro.blog. It is what Manton envisioned: <strong>a thoughtful space for people to write and share and converse.</strong> I love it the way it is. The community and the experience has evolved in its own way, thanks to the contributions and participation of lots of individual humans.</p>

			 <p>Shaming people who leave a toxic place because the new place is not 100% non-toxic is a weird flex that happens on Twitter right now.</p>
<p>Sure Twitter alternatives are not the most accessible, but neither was Twitter when you joined it (unless you joined in the last 12 months or so). Pretending Twitter didn’t become accessible because people joined it in the inaccessible state and lobbied hard for it to become better is not recognizing Twitter’s history in this area.</p>
<p>Yes, Mastodon is not super accessible, and there are barriers. But there are <a href="https://fedi.tips/mastodon-and-fediverse-accessibility-tips/">good and well-documented workarounds</a> (like there were on Twitter back in the day!) which we can build upon. Because nothing is won when Twitter is defunct and there is no alternative. We have to start now.</p>

			 <p><em>I really don’t want to talk about Twitter’s demise, but part of my grieving process seems to be to think about it. So, sorry.</em></p>
<p>It’s not surprising but still shocking to see that most people do not have any contingency at all for losing their primary social network. If <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendster">Friendster</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pownce">Pownce</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App.net">App.net</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities">GeoCities</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace">Myspace</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes_Ping">Ping</a> have taught us anything then that even big networks do fail (and Ping). Some crumble gradually and lose their usefulness. Others explode into fiery supernovas and burn out.</p>
<p>People active in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndieWeb">indie web</a> community have always warned from putting all content into one social network that you do not have control over. But that is exactly what many people have done with Twitter. And I get it. Not everyone can and wants to have their own website. We see the same thing happen with sites like Linktree. But if your – for the lack of better words – content creation relies on a singular platform you have no control over, you should expect it to go away at any moment, and plan accordingly.</p>
<p>That is why I am encouraging people to test out alternatives, even if there are obstacles and (accessibility) barriers. Because learning work-arounds and favorite ways to interact on different platforms <em>now</em> is much easier than doing it later. You don’t have to switch 100% or burn your Twitter account, nobody expects that. Experiment with an account on Mastodon or micro.blog or Myspace (turns out it’s not 100% dead yet).</p>
<p>I still reply and interact with people on Twitter and there is a good chance you came to this post from there. That’s totally fine. Use what is comfortable for you, but also be aware of your options.</p>

			 <p>Lots of people refer to different Mastodon instances as “silos” in contrast to Twitter where there are “no silos”. The reality is the opposite because all instances talk to each other. Twitter is the mall where you get a place but it sets the rules and doesn’t let you talk to other shops in other malls. The fediverse is high street with individual shops that talk to each other.</p>

			 <p>Today I think I repaired my front bike inner tube properly. I got a bike holder to put my bike on while working on it, and after I set it up, I thought I could take another look at the inner tube. Turns out the patch got lose again, probably during reassembly or while adding air.</p>
<p>I also found out that the tube that I got from the shop is only a 24/28-622 size tube, which is very small for a 45-622 wheel. So I probably inflated it too much to fill the wheel, making a defect more likely.</p>
<p>I will see if it holds the air over night but I’ll probably switch out the inner tube to the right size one once I get it tomorrow. This is fun to figure out, even if a bit frustrating. But better at home in the garage than on the track.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781785633164">The Patrios Network</a> by Antony Johnston 📚</p>
<p>In his latest book, Antony not only works through the Covid pandemic and the rise of right-wing militaristic groups, but also weaves together an intriguing tech-spy story. Brigitte Sharp is (as always) a brilliant protagonist, but the book also paints a more well rounded picture of her place in SIS and the world. Tension is always high and there is rarely a time to breath.</p>
<p>I loved it.</p>

			 <p>One of the more complicated things was how to show icons on the Inkplate 6COLOR. Now, generally it is pretty easy: You take the graphic, you convert it into a C header file, import it and then render it to the screen.</p>
<p>However, there are a few challenges: The <a href="https://inkplate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/arduino.html#inkplate-drawbitmap3bit"><code>drawBitmap3Bit</code></a> function that is used cannot scale the icon, which is a bit weird because it takes the size of the icon as parameters. But scaling is just not something that this function does.</p>
<p>It’s best is to export an icon immediately in the format and size you want to use. I exported from Sketch and that worked fine.</p>
<p>For icons that have the background full colored in one of the seven colors, make sure to make the color as close to the pure Inkplate color as possible:</p>
<table>

<tr>
<th>Color</th>
<th>Constant</th>
<th style="text-align:center">Value</th>
<th style="text-align:center">Hex</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Black</td>
<td>INKPLATE_BLACK</td>
<td style="text-align:center">0</td>
<td style="text-align:center">#000000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>White</td>
<td>INKPLATE_WHITE</td>
<td style="text-align:center">1</td>

<td>INKPLATE_BLUE</td>
<td style="text-align:center">3</td>
<td style="text-align:center">#0000FF</td>

<td style="text-align:center">4</td>
<td style="text-align:center">#FF0000</td>

<td>INKPLATE_YELLOW</td>
<td style="text-align:center">5</td>
<td style="text-align:center">#FFFF00</td>

<td>INKPLATE_ORANGE</td>
<td style="text-align:center">6</td>
<td style="text-align:center">#FF8800</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I tried out using half-transparent colors, but when I enabled dithering, it did also dither areas that had a solid color. I think going monochrome is best for icons, or you have to manually dither beforehand.</p>
<p>Then, use the [image converter] and upload the image. Select the correct Inkplate board and you should be good to go. Enter the pixel size of your image to get the best representation and click “Convert”. The code is output below the buttons and I almost overlooked it. It also has a preview of the file. Download the “Header File” and place it next to your Arduino sketch file.</p>
<p>You can then import the file using</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>where <code>iconname</code> is your icon’s filename and also means that three variables are defined which you can immediately use in the aforementioned <a href="https://inkplate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/arduino.html#inkplate-drawbitmap3bit"><code>drawBitmap3Bit</code></a> function:</p>
<ul>
<li>iconname → the graphic information</li>
<li>iconname_w → width</li>
<li>iconname_w → height</li>
</ul>
<p>The following code would output a brain graphic in the middle of the screen:</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>How I got my <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/soldered/inkplate-6color">Inkplate 6COLOR</a> running on macOS:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install Python 3. (I already had that, you can check the command line <code>which python 3</code> and if there is a result, you are good to go.)</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://github.com/adrianmihalko/ch340g-ch34g-ch34x-mac-os-x-driver">the CH340 driver</a>. This driver basically is responsible for having macOS “see the device” through USB.</li>
<li>Install the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software#legacy-ide-18x"><strong>legacy</strong> Arduino IDE (version 1.8.x)</a>. Did I try the 2.0 version? Yes! Did it completely break wifi and networking until a restart? Also yes! The legacy version works flawlessly.</li>
<li>Open Arduino IDE and go to settings. Paste the following URL into the ”Additional Boards Manager URL” field: <code>https://github.com/e-radionicacom/Dasduino-Board-Definitions-for-Arduino-IDE/raw/master/package_Dasduino_Boards_index.json</code>. This makes the instructions and libraries available to Arduino.</li>
<li>Go to Tools → Board: “…” → Boards Manager… → Search for Inkplate → Install</li>
<li>After installation is complete, run the following command on your command line: <code>sed -i -e 's/=python /=python3 /g' ~/Library/Arduino15/packages/Inkplate_Boards/hardware/esp32/*/platform.txt</code>. This basically replaces all calls to <code>python</code> with calls to the previously installed <code>python3</code>.</li>
<li>Connect the display and press the button next to the USB-C port. Select the port of the display from the Tools → Port menu in Arduino IDE. Here it looks like <code>/dev/cu.wchusbserial14310</code> – Note that the number behind the name can change when you change ports.</li>
<li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/e-radionicacom/Inkplate-Arduino-library/tree/master/examples/Inkplate6COLOR">example files</a>.</li>
<li>Open an example in Arduino IDE 1.8 by selecting the <code>.ino</code> file in a folder. Press the checkmark to verify the code, and the right pointing arrow to deploy it to your display.</li>
<li>Some examples might need additional Libraries, like the super useful <a href="https://arduinojson.org">ArduinoJson</a> one. To install such a library go to Tools → Manage Libraries… → Search for the library you need and press install.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://inkplate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">Read the Manual.</a></strong> While I struggled to set it up so m computer was able to communicate and deploy Arduino programs to the display, once it was set up the different drawing and text output methods are pretty straight forward to understand. That said, it helps if you have seen C++ code in your life before as some descriptions use notations that are easier to understand that way.</li>
</ol>

			 <p>Awesome <a href="http://www.snooker.org/res/index.asp?event=1365">Hong Kong Masters</a> final between Ronnie O’Sullivan and Marco Fu.</p>
<p>Ronnie getting into a commanding lead before the mid-session interval and then struggleing a little to get over the line. No super-high breaks, but Ronnie’s 114 clearance basically without black and pink in the final frame was excellent.</p>
<p>And Marco punched over his weight, too. A close contest was expected after the 147 Maximum in the semi final. And Marco didn’t disappoint. After a tense start, he found his cool and got better into the match.</p>
<p>Add 8000+ spectators, a record for Snooker in, and it was a really formidable contest. Plus: excellent mask wearing! So civil!</p>

			 <p>Some words of advice I just shared to my colleagues in Austin who have a winter storm they don’t have the infrastructure to deal with, including power outages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Please stay safe.</li>
<li>Stay inside.</li>
<li>Turn your phones off in case you need it in an emergency and there is no power.</li>
<li>Get lots of blankets and multiple layers of clothes.</li>
<li>Especially protect extremities and wear a warm cap. Put it over your ears.</li>
<li>Put tea/coffee in thermos and drink it slowly over multiple hours, that gives you some warmth over the day.</li>
<li>If you have large glass windows or doors, put blankets over them. The air trapped between the window and the blanket is isolating.</li>
<li>If you run a gas stove, open the window (a little bit) when using it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, and don’t expect to be productive or clear thinking when it is very cold. Your body needs the energy to keep warm. That’s normal.</p>

			 <p>Okay, #a11y peeps. Is it really a problem to have an <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> inside of the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element? I have seen that assessment a couple of times, and I question if that’s correct.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#complementary">ARIA Spec says about <code>role=&quot;complementary&quot;</code>, which <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> has</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A supporting section of the document, designed to be complementary to the main content at a similar level in the DOM hierarchy, but remains meaningful when separated from the main content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar level <em>feels</em> like it permits nesting. Does it create any tangible downsides in practice?</p>

			 <p>My brain is going hard into data crunching mode while sleeping in the last two days. It is almost as if it recognizes that it has time to do that and does not need to be aware to fight-or-flight. Probably great for my mental health, but it feels like I worked throught the night.</p>

			 <p>Apparently this weekend is a Raspberry Pi &amp; Homebridge update kind of weekend. That’s fun!</p>
<p>Turns out installing Node.js on a Raspberry Pi Zero is getting ever more complicated. I should write up what I have done so I don’t have to figure it out <em>again</em> next time!</p>
